## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[No, I did not use any outside resources for help. I only used code path instructions for help.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[There wasn't really any challenging part I came across because the code path instruction was very help in the step by step instruction. The part i did get stuck on was the guess part because I didn't see that there more to do after and was confused on what they meant by game logic and after 40 min of looking i found in by clicking the guess bar.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[how often do company hire web developer, what are most common struggles for new developer, and what kind of math do web developers us on a daily when completing work assignment.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[if i had a few more hours, I would probably spend it on studying the code and trying new thing to understand logic behind it. I would try implememnt the speed up option.]
